This Assignment (PA4)s purpose was to create a Matrix ADT using a generic List ADT, and implement
it into a client file called sparse. Sparse was to read in an input file and perform operations
on said matrices.
Here are the Files I used:
- List.c 
- List.h 
- Matrix.c 
- Matrix.h 
- MatrixTest.c 
- ListTest.c 
- Makefile 
- README (this file)

- List.c and List.h have been modified to now serve as a generic List ADT. Functionality is the same, but
you now have to cast whatever type you wanted in your node.

- Matrix.c and Matrix.h are the main ADT of this assignment. They implement functions such as changeEntry,
sum, diff, and product, as well as transpose, copy, and others.

- MatrixTest.c and ListTest.c are files that were provided as weak test for the matrix and list ADT respectively.

Unfortunately, last week I had some circumstances that led to me not starting this assignment until just a while ago. Even with the deadline being extended, I wasn't really able to get the Matrix ADT working to the best of my ability, and didn't get around to writing the client program.
